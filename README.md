# ok-storage

**ok-storage** is the persistent storage layer of [OpenKubes](https://github.com/openkubes/openkubes).

It owns the storage **contract** consumed by every OpenKubes capability — ok-cluster,
ok-apps, and any Crossplane Composition that requests a PVC — never a specific
implementation.

> OpenKubes owns the contracts, not the components.
> ok-storage defines what a volume guarantees. Longhorn is today's implementation.
> See [ADR-Platform-009](https://github.com/openkubes/openkubes/blob/main/architecture/decisions/ADR-Platform-009-storage-contract.md)
> for the full decision record.

## The Contract

| StorageClass | Access Mode | Guarantees |
|---|---|---|
| `ok-storage-block` (default) | RWO | Replicated (>=2), survives single node failure, snapshot/restore, online expansion |
| `ok-storage-shared` | RWX | Shared storage required by KubeVirt live migration and multi-pod workloads, same durability as block |
| `ok-storage-local` | RWO | Node-local, non-replicated — scratch, cache, reproducible data only |

No manifest in any `ok-*` repo may reference an implementation-specific
StorageClass (e.g. `longhorn`, `rook-ceph-block`). The three names above are
the only stable interface.

## Current Implementation: Longhorn v1

Chosen for the current hardware: two bare-metal storage nodes (`ok-infra`,
`ok-gpu`), which rules out Ceph's 3-monitor quorum requirement. Longhorn
fulfills the full contract at `numberOfReplicas: 2`.

- Redundancy lives on exactly **one** layer — the RKE2 host cluster.
  Workload (Talos) clusters do not run their own Longhorn; nesting would be
  4x write amplification for no benefit.
- RWX (`ok-storage-shared`) is served via Longhorn's built-in share-manager
  and is what makes KubeVirt live migration possible.
- Both storage nodes are fully partitioned (no free NVMe), so Longhorn's
  data path is `/var/lib/longhorn` on the root filesystem with an explicit
  storage reservation — see [`values/longhorn-values.yaml`](values/longhorn-values.yaml).
- HA parameters are version-controlled here, not tribal knowledge.

### Migration path: Rook/Ceph

Ceph is **deferred, not rejected**. A 2-node Ceph cluster is an anti-pattern
(split-brain risk on quorum); Ceph becomes the preferred implementation once
a third storage node exists. Because consumers only ever reference the
`ok-storage-*` contract names, that swap is transparent to every workload.

## Usage

```bash
make prereqs        # install open-iscsi + nfs-common on ok-infra, ok-gpu
make install        # deploy Longhorn with the version-controlled HA values
make apply-classes  # apply ok-storage-block / -shared / -local
make status         # Longhorn nodes, volumes, and the contract StorageClasses
```

### Uninstall

`deletingConfirmationFlag` is left at its default (`false`) — Longhorn's own
safety guard against accidental deletion. `make uninstall` will fail with
`BackoffLimitExceeded` until you explicitly confirm:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml -n longhorn-system \
  patch settings.longhorn.io deleting-confirmation-flag --type merge -p '{"value":"true"}'
make uninstall
```

StorageClasses are untouched by `make uninstall` (`reclaimPolicy: Retain`);
run `make clean` separately if you also want those removed.

## Testing

`tests/` contains verification manifests for each contract StorageClass —
not part of the contract itself, just proof it actually works on this
cluster. Safe to apply and delete any time; nothing here is meant to be
left running.

**`ok-storage-block`** — confirms a replicated RWO volume schedules across
both nodes:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml apply -f tests/verify-block.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml wait --for=condition=Ready pod/ok-storage-test --timeout=60s
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml exec ok-storage-test -- sh -c 'echo hello > /data/hello.txt && cat /data/hello.txt'

# verify replica placement (expect one on each node)
PV=$(kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml get pvc ok-storage-test -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}')
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml -n longhorn-system get replicas.longhorn.io \
  -l longhornvolume=$PV -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,NODE:.spec.nodeID,STATE:.status.currentState

kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml delete -f tests/verify-block.yaml
```

**`ok-storage-shared`** — confirms two pods can mount the same volume at
once (real shared access, not just independent mounts):

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml apply -f tests/verify-shared.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml wait --for=condition=Ready pod/ok-storage-test-a pod/ok-storage-test-b --timeout=120s

kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml exec ok-storage-test-a -- sh -c 'echo "written by pod A" > /data/shared.txt'
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml exec ok-storage-test-b -- cat /data/shared.txt   # expect: written by pod A

kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/ok-infra.yaml delete -f tests/verify-shared.yaml
```

Consume it like any other StorageClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
  storageClassName: ok-storage-block
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```
